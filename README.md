Description
===========

Installs and configures x11vnc

Usage
=====

Fill out the password in attributes/default.rb if you want to protect with a password.
The default port is 5901 instead of 5900.

I created this fork from John Goulah's [x11vnc cookbook](https://github.com/jgoulah/x11vnc-cookbook) because I
found it had issues running on xubuntu 12.10.
